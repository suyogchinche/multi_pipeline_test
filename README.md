# Written this shared libraries to use in jenkins declarative pipeline

- Why shared libraries are required ?
We were using groovy language(built on top java) for writing pipelines in jenkins file and then started using decalrative pipeline.
We can write jenkins file using two ways 
1. Scripted (Pure groovy based)
2. Declarative (Human understandable language and easy to use)
